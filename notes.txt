Areas for improvement:
    hyperoptimization - 
        grid search:
            make list of all parameters for each category
            run simulation with each set of params
            record performance for all sets
            report params for top 10 runs or whatever
        
    distance metrics - 
        mahalanobis
        chebychev?? whatever
        scaled? see if normalization matters
        ask if jasper has his done :)
    
    fusion techniques - 
        search online for more possibilities
        consider ML, i.e. NN or tree from ITAD
    
    decision intervals - 
        write out to csv or something
        perform visualization automatically
        determine relationship between other params and interval, esp instance threshold
    
    benchmarking - 
        benchmark sections of simulation
        find the bottleneck and speed it up?? lol
        might help to do this before hyperoptimization, but maybe not necessary
    
    discuss results w/ dave and prof - 
        see about writing paper and what can be reported after hyperoptimization
