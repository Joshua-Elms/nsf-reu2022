When bringing in the data from the google drive I shared,
make sure to create a new folder under "keystroke_dynamics" called "data". 

Inside this folder, you can drop the three files from the drive and unzip the two compressed files. 

After unzipping them, you can optionally delete the zipped files as you won't need them. 

For clarity, change the names to the following:
    filtered_dataset -> clarkson2_files
    ml_features -> typenet_files
    DSL-StrongPasswordData.txt -> cmu_data.txt

After this, we can all write scripts for compatability with anybody running this repository.
