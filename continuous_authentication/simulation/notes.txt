Stuff

* include more filters (remove users with bad words, require n shared words between users)
* rather than allocating test blocks, just scan test samples for n words shared rather than using all words from text block
*** count # of shared words for each block of test words, analyze how often we get low shared word counts; if low word count is found, add on another block until you hit the # of words for shared threshold
* 
* for imposter: open system principle?
* Actual easy ways to improve:
    score level fusion - length based
    manual / programmatic hyperparameter optimization
    parametrize as much as possible to allow fine control


Log number of shared instances!!!
